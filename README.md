Programming language: C

 To prepared data containing information about the Video Library, the data were arranged in the form of a record containing the following fields: Number, Film, Country, Time, Genre, Date. The number of entries was arbitrary. Created a program of records of prepared data for an external file and a program for processing this external file that performed the following operations: 

 - Displayed data on the screen; 
 - Adds records to the beginning or end of the file;        
 - Deletes all data about a movie whose number is specified by the user and displays; updated file contents on the screen;
 - Sort the genres of films by alphabet; 
 - List of films taken in certain countries; 
 - List of movies that are given from the keyboard and start with a certain letter; 
 - List of films shot before 1992. 

 The program contains a menu and I / O in the windows on the screen. In the development of the program applied the technology of downstream design. Logically completed fragments to be arranged in the form of subroutines, all necessary data to which are transmitted through the list of parameters.
