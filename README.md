• List of movies that are given from the keyboard and start with a certain letter; 
• List of films shot before 1992. 

 The program must contain a menu and I / O in the windows on the screen. In the development of the program apply 
 the technology of downstream design. Logically completed fragments to be arranged in the form of subroutines, all necessary 
 data to which are transmitted through the list of parameters. The use of global variables should be avoided.
